# Walmart-Sales-Data-Analysis-Project-
This project delivers a comprehensive end-to-end data analysis solution aimed at uncovering valuable business insights from Walmart sales data. By leveraging Python for data cleaning, processing, and analysis, and SQL for advanced data querying, we address essential business questions through a structured problem-solving approach. This project is perfect for data analysts seeking to enhance their expertise in data manipulation, SQL operations, and building efficient data pipelines.

# Project Workflow
# 1. Environment Setup
Tools Used: Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Python, MySQL, PostgreSQL
Objective: Create a well-organized workspace in VS Code with clear folder structures to streamline development and data handling processes.

# 2. Kaggle API Configuration
API Setup: Obtain the Kaggle API token (JSON file) from your Kaggle profile settings.
Configuration Steps:
Save the kaggle.json file in the .kaggle directory.
Use the command kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-path> to fetch the Walmart sales dataset directly into the project.

# 3. Data Acquisition
Source: Download Walmart Sales Data from Kaggle using the API.
Storage: Save the dataset in a designated folder (data/) for easy access and management.

# 4. Install Dependencies and Load Data
Required Libraries: Install necessary libraries using:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python psycopg2
Data Loading: Use Pandas to load the dataset into a DataFrame for exploration and processing.

# 5. Initial Data Exploration
Goal: Understand the dataset structure, column types, and key statistics.
Steps:
Use methods like .info(), .describe(), and .head() to analyze the data.
Identify patterns, missing values, and potential issues.

# 6. Data Cleaning
Tasks:
Remove Duplicates: Eliminate duplicate rows to maintain data integrity.
Handle Missing Values: Drop or fill null values depending on their significance.
Data Type Correction: Ensure consistency in column types, such as converting dates to datetime and prices to float.
Currency Standardization: Clean and format currency columns using .replace() for analysis readiness.
Validation: Verify the cleaned data for any remaining inconsistencies.

# 7. Feature Engineering
New Feature: Add a calculated column, Total Amount, by multiplying unit_price by quantity.
Purpose: Enhance the dataset for more streamlined SQL queries and business insights.

# 8. Data Loading into Databases
Setup: Establish connections to MySQL and PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy.
Steps:
Automate table creation and data insertion into both databases.
Run basic queries to verify successful data transfer.

# 9. SQL Analysis and Business Insights
Objective: Solve critical business questions using SQL queries.

Key Analyses:
Identify revenue trends by branch and product categories.
Determine the best-selling product categories.
Analyze sales performance across time, locations, and payment methods.
Identify peak sales hours and customer purchasing behaviors.
Conduct profit margin analysis by branch and category.
Documentation: Record each query with its goal, approach, and results for clarity.

# 10. Project Documentation and Publishing
Steps:
Create clear project documentation using Markdown or Jupyter Notebook.
Include:
README.md: Overview, steps, and findings.
SQL Scripts: Organized queries for reference.
Data Access Instructions: Steps to acquire or replicate the dataset.
Publish the project on GitHub for visibility.
